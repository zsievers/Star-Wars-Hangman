-I used basic <em>html</em> and <em>CSS</em> to format the page.<br>
-Used <em>javascript</em> to push the users key to the page. <br>
-If users guess is WRONG, letter is pushed to "Letters Guessed" div.<br> 
-If users guess is CORRECT, letter is pushed to the chosen word. <br>

Technical Approach: <br>
-press any key to start game <br>
-have words ready to be guessed <Br>
-number of guess set <br>
-have number of "_" to signify how many letters are in the current word <br>
-have letters reveal themselves in the word or in letter pile when guessed. <br> 
-If user guesses word, game stops and animation is cued. <br>
-if user doesn't get word in set amount of guesses, you lose animation is cued. <br>
-After win/loss the game automatically choose another word to and play again. <br>
